  "limitationsTitle": "Important Limitations",
  "limitation1": "• Dermoscopy requires training and experience to interpret correctly",
  "limitation2": "• AI analysis is a screening tool, not a definitive diagnosis",
  "limitation3": "• Some lesion types are difficult to classify even with dermoscopy",
